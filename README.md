👋 Hi, I’m @nreboucas

I'm a dedicated student who is building a foundation in programming logic and Java while nurturing a deep interest in quality management and processes.

- 👨‍🎓 I'm currently delving into the world of technology through CS50, where I have the opportunity to dive into the complexities of programming logic. I believe a strong grasp of this foundation is crucial for robust and efficient software development.

- ☕ My primary focus of study is Java. With it, I intend to explore the realm of software development, building processing modules, and enhancing my programming skills.

- 🧐 Beyond code, I have a strong interest in quality management and process optimization. I believe that the combination of a solid programming foundation with a deep understanding of quality management can lead to effective and high-quality software solutions.

- 💼 I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in practical projects that integrate programming logic, Java, and the principles of quality management. This combination can result in efficient and error-free systems.

- 🤝 I'm open to connecting with professionals in the fields of software development and quality management because I believe collaboration and shared learning are essential for growth.

- 🔗 If you share my enthusiasm for programming logic, Java, and quality management, I'd be delighted to connect with you on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathbou).

- 🚀 My goal is to continue deepening my knowledge in programming logic and Java while applying these skills to enhance the quality and efficiency of processes in future projects.
